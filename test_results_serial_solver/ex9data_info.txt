The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 101
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 398
The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 398
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 1586
The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 1586
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 6338
Number of nodes is too many or too few! Nodes = 6338
The solution does not converge, Stop!, alpha = 1
