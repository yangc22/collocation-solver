method: LOBATTO, stages: 10
The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 101
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 398
The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 398
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 1300
The solution does not converge at the alpha line-search, Remesh!, alpha = 1; Nodes = 1300
Remeshed!, Number of nodes = 4424
Number of nodes is too many or too few! Nodes = 4424
The solution does not converge, Stop!, alpha = 1
